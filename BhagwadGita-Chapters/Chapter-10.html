  <div class="chapterIntro"> 
   <p>This chapter is narrated by Lord Krishna to help Arjun meditate on God by reflecting upon his magnificent and resplendent glories. In chapter nine, Shree Krishna revealed the science of bhakti, or loving devotion, and described some of his opulences. Here, he expounds further on his infinite glories, with the desire to increase Arjun’s bhakti. These verses are pleasing to read and enchanting to hear.</p> 
   <p>Shree Krishna reveals that he is the source of everything that exists. The varieties of qualities of humans arise from him. The seven great Sages, the four great Saints, and the fourteen Manus were born from his mind, and from them all people in the world have descended. Those who know that everything proceeds from him engage in his devotion with great faith. Such devotees derive great satisfaction in conversing about his glories and enlightening others about him. Since their minds are united with him, he dwelling within their hearts gives the divine knowledge by which they can easily attain him.</p> 
   <p>Upon hearing him, Arjun declares that he is convinced entirely about Shree Krishna’s paramount position, and proclaims him to be the Supreme Divine Personality. He requests the Lord to further describe his divine glories that are like nectar to hear. Shree Krishna reveals that since he is the beginning, middle, and end of all things, everything that exists is a manifestation of his powers. He is the infinite reservoir of beauty, glory, power, knowledge, and opulence. Whenever we observe extraordinary splendor anywhere, whatever catches our imagination, sends us in raptures, and infuses us with bliss, we should know it to be but a spark of the opulence of God. He is the powerhouse from where all beings and things get their magnificence. For the remaining portion of the chapter, he goes on to describe the objects, personalities, and activities that best display his opulence. Finally, he concludes by saying that the magnitude of his glory cannot be judged by the sum total of what he has described, for he upholds unlimited universes in a fraction of his being. Thus, we must make God, who is the source of all glory, the object of our worship.</p>
