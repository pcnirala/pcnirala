  <div class="chapterIntro"> 
   <p>The previous chapter explained in detail the distinction between the soul and the material body. This chapter describes the nature of the material energy, which is the source of the body and its elements, and is thus the origin of both mind and matter. Shree Krishna explains that material nature is constituted of three modes (guṇas)—goodness, passion, and ignorance. The body, mind, and intellect that are made from the material energy also possess these three modes, and the mix of the modes in our being determines the color of our personality. The mode of goodness is characterized by peacefulness, well-being, virtue, and serenity; the mode of passion gives rise to endless desires and insatiable ambitions for worldly enhancement; and the mode of ignorance is the cause for delusion, laziness, intoxication, and sleep. Until the soul attains illumination, it must learn to deal with these three powerful forces of material nature. Liberation lies in transcending all three of these modes.</p> 
   <p>Shree Krishna reveals a simple solution for breaking out of the bondage of these guṇas. The Supreme Lord is transcendental to the three modes, and if we attach ourselves to him, then our mind will also rise to the divine platform. At this point, Arjun enquires about the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the three guṇas. Shree Krishna then systematically explains the traits of such liberated souls. He explains that illumined persons remain ever equipoised; they are not disturbed when they see the guṇas functioning in the world, and their effects manifesting in persons, objects, and situations. They see everything as a manifestation of God’s energies, which are ultimately in his hands. Thus, worldly situations neither make them jubilant nor miserable, and without wavering, they remain established in the self. The chapter ends with Shree Krishna again reminding us of the power of devotion and its ability to make us transcend the three guṇas.</p>

    <p> O mighty-armed Arjun, the material energy consists of three <i>guṇas</i> (modes)—<i>sattva</i> (goodness), <i>rajas</i> (passion), and <i>tamas</i> (ignorance). These modes bind the eternal soul to the perishable body. </p>

    <p> Amongst these, <i>sattva guṇa</i>, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is illuminating and full of well-being. O sinless one, it binds the soul by creating attachment for a sense of happiness and knowledge. </p>

    <p> When all the gates of the body are illumined by knowledge, know it to be a manifestation of the mode of goodness. When the mode of passion predominates, O Arjun, the symptoms of greed, exertion for worldly gain, restlessness, and craving develop. O Arjun, nescience, inertia, negligence, and delusion—these are the dominant signs of the mode of ignorance. </p>

    <p> The Supreme Divine Personality said: O Arjun, The persons who are transcendental to the three <i>guṇas</i> neither hate illumination (which is born of <i>sattva</i>), nor activity (which is born of <i>rajas</i>), nor even delusion (which is born of <i>tamas</i>), when these are abundantly present, nor do they long for them when they are absent.
