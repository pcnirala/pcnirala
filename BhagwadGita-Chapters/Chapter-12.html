  <div class="chapterIntro"> 
   <p>This small chapter stresses on the super-excellence of the path of loving devotion over all other types of spiritual practices. It begins with Arjun asking Shree Krishna whom he considers more perfect in Yog—those who are devoted to the personal form of God or those who worship the formless Brahman. Shree Krishna responds by declaring that both paths lead to God-realization. However, he regards the devotees of his personal form as the best yogis. He explains that meditation on the impersonal unmanifest aspect of God is full of tribulations and is exceedingly difficult for embodied beings. But devotees of the personal form, with their consciousness merged in him and all their actions dedicated to him, are swiftly delivered from the cycle of life and death. Shree Krishna thus asks Arjun to surrender his intellect to him, and fix his mind in exclusive loving devotion on him alone.</p> 
   <p>However, such love is often not forthcoming in the struggling soul. So Shree Krishna gives other options, and says that if Arjun cannot immediately reach the stage of complete absorption of the mind in God, he should strive to reach that stage of perfection by constant practice. Devotion is not a mysterious gift and can be cultivated by regular effort. If Arjun cannot do even this much, he should still not admit defeat; rather he should work in devotion for the pleasure of Shree Krishna. If this is also not possible, then he should merely renounce the fruits of his works and be situated in the self. He then explains that higher than mechanical practice is the cultivation of knowledge; higher than the cultivation of knowledge is meditation; and higher than meditation is the renunciation of fruits of actions, which immediately leads to great peace. The remaining verses of the chapter describe the wonderful qualities of God’s loving devotees who are very dear to him.</p>

    <p> But those who worship the formless aspect of the Absolute Truth—the imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifest, the all-pervading, the unthinkable, the unchanging, the eternal, and the immoveable—by restraining their senses and being even-minded everywhere, such persons, engaged in the welfare of all beings, also attain me. </p>
