  <div class="chapterIntro"> 
   <p>In the previous chapter, Shree Krishna explained that by transcending the three modes of material nature one attains the divine goal. He also revealed that the best means for going beyond the guṇas is to engage in exclusive devotion. To engage in such devotion, we must detach the mind from the world and attach it to God alone. Thus, it is necessary to understand the nature of the world. In this chapter, Shree Krishna explains this material world in a graphic manner, to help Arjun develop detachment from it. He compares the material world to an upside down aśhvatth tree (sacred fig). The embodied soul wanders up and down the branches of the tree, from lifetime to lifetime, without comprehending from where it originated, how long it has existed, and how it keeps growing. The roots of the tree are above, as it has its source in God. The fruitive activities described in the Vedas are like its leaves. The tree is irrigated by the three modes of material nature. These modes create sense objects that are like the buds on the tree. The buds sprout aerial roots that engender further growth of the tree. The chapter describes this symbolism in detail, to convey the idea of how the embodied soul suffering in this material world only keeps perpetuating its bondage here, in ignorance of the nature of this tree of material existence. Shree Krishna explains that the axe of detachment must be used to cut down the tree. Then, we must search for the base of the tree, which is the Supreme Lord himself. Finding the source, we must surrender to him in the manner described in this chapter, and then will attain the divine abode of God, from where we will not return to the material world again.</p> 
   <p>Shree Krishna then describes how the souls in this world are divine, being his eternal fragmental parts. But bound by material nature, they are struggling with the six senses including the mind. He explains how the embodied soul, though divine, savors the material objects of the senses. He also describes how the soul transmigrates to a new body at the time of death, carrying with it the mind and senses from the present life. The ignorant neither realize the presence of the soul in the body, nor when it departs from it upon death. But yogis perceive it with the eyes of knowledge and by the purity of their mind. In the same way, God is also present in his creation, but he needs to be perceived with the eyes of knowledge. Shree Krishna reveals how we can cognize the existence of God in this world through his glories that shine forth everywhere. The chapter ends with explanations of the terms: kṣhar, akṣhar, and Puruṣhottam. Kṣhar are the perishable beings of the material realm. Akṣhar are the liberated beings in the abode of God. Puruṣhottam is the Supreme Divine Personality, who is the unchanging controller and sustainer of the world. He is transcendental to both the perishable and imperishable beings. He must be worshipped with all our being.</p>

    <p> The branches of the tree extend upward and downward, nourished by the three <i>guṇas</i>, with the objects of the senses as tender buds. The roots of the tree hang downward, causing the flow of karma in the human form. Below, its roots branch out causing (karmic) actions in the world of humans. </p>

    <p> The real form of this tree is not perceived in this world, neither its beginning nor end, nor its continued existence. But this deep-rooted <i>aśhvatth</i> tree must be cut down with a strong axe of detachment. Then one must search out the base of the tree, which is the Supreme Lord, from whom streamed forth the activity of the universe a long time ago. Upon taking refuge in him, one will not return to this world again. </p>
