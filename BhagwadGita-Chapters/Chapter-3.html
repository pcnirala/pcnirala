  <div class="chapterIntro"> 
   <p>In this chapter, Shree Krishna explains that all beings are compelled to work by their intrinsic modes of nature, and nobody can remain without action for even a moment. Those who display external renunciation by donning the ochre robes, but internally dwell upon sense objects, are hypocrites. Superior to them are those who practice karm yog, and continue to engage in action externally, but give up attachment from within. Shree Krishna then stresses that all living beings have responsibilities to fulfill as integral parts of the system of God’s creation. When we execute our prescribed duties as an obligation to God, such work becomes yajña (sacrifice). The performance of yajña is naturally pleasing to the celestial gods, and they bestow us with material prosperity. Such yajña causes the rains to fall, and rain begets grains which are necessary for sustenance of life. Those who do not accept their responsibility in this cycle are sinful; they live only for the delight of their senses, and their lives are in vain.</p> 
   <p>Shree Krishna then explains that unlike the rest of humankind, the enlightened souls who are situated in the self are not obliged to fulfill bodily responsibilities, for they are executing higher responsibilities at the level of the soul. However, if they abandon their social duties, it creates discord in the minds of common people, who tend to follow in the footsteps of the great ones. So, to set a good example for the world to emulate, the wise should continue working, although without any motive for personal reward. This will prevent the ignorant from prematurely abandoning their prescribed duties. It was for this purpose that enlightened kings in the past, such as King Janak and others, performed their works.</p> 
   <p>Arjun then asks why people commit sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if by force. The Supreme Lord explains that the all-devouring sinful enemy of the world is lust alone. As a fire is covered by smoke, and a mirror is masked by dust, in the same way desire shrouds one’s knowledge and drags away the intellect. Shree Krishna then gives the clarion call to Arjun to slay this enemy called desire, which is the embodiment of sin, and bring his senses, mind, and intellect under control.</p>
