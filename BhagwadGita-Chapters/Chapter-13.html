  <div class="chapterIntro"> 
   <p>The Bhagavad Gita consists of eighteen chapters, which are composed of three segments. The first set of six chapters describes karm yog. The second set describes the glories of bhakti, and for the nourishment of bhakti, it also dwells upon the opulences of God. The third set of six chapters expounds upon tattva jñāna (knowledge scriptural terms and principles). The present one is the first of the third set of chapters, and it introduces two terms—kṣhetra (the “field”) and kṣhetrajña (the “knower of the field”). We may think of the field as the body and the knower of the field as the soul that resides within. But this is a simplification, for the field is actually much more—it includes the mind, intellect, and ego, and all other components of the material energy that comprise our personality. In this wider sense, the field of the body encompasses all aspects of our personality, except for the soul who is the “knower the field.”</p> 
   <p>As a farmer sows seeds in a field and reaps the harvest from it, we sow the field of our body with good or bad thoughts and actions, and reap the consequent destiny. The Buddha had explained: “All that we are is the result of what we have thought; it is founded on our thoughts; and it is made of our thoughts.” Therefore, as we think, that is what we become. The great American thinker, Ralph Waldo Emerson, said: “The ancestor of every action is thought.” Thus, we must learn the art of cultivating the field of our body with appropriate thoughts and actions. This requires knowledge of the distinction between the field and the knower of the field. In the present chapter, Shree Krishna goes into a detailed analysis of this distinction. He enumerates the elements of material nature that compose the field of the body. He describes the modifications that arise in the field, in the form of emotions, sentiments, and feelings. He also mentions the virtues and qualities that purify the field and illumine it with the light of knowledge. Such knowledge helps us gain realization of the soul, who is the knower of the field. The chapter then describes God, who is the supreme knower of the fields of all the living beings. That Supreme Lord holds contradictory attributes, i.e. he possesses opposite qualities at the same time. So, he is all-pervading in creation and yet seated in the hearts of all living beings. He is thus the Supreme Soul of all living beings.</p> 
   <p>Having described the soul, the Supreme Soul, and material nature, Shree Krishna then explains which of these is responsible for actions by living beings, and also which is responsible for cause and effect in the world at large. Those, who can perceive these distinctions and properly pinpoint the causes of action, are the ones who actually see; and they are the ones who are situated in knowledge. They observe the Supreme Soul present in all living beings, and so they do not degrade themselves by their mind. They can see the variety of living beings situated in the same material nature. And when they see the common spiritual substratum pervading all existence, they attain the realization of Brahman.</p>
