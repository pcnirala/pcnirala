  <div class="chapterIntro"> 
   <p>This chapter compares the path of karm sanyās (renunciation of actions) with the path of karm yog (work in devotion). Shree Krishna explains that both lead to the same goal, and we can choose either of them. However, renunciation of actions cannot be done perfectly until the mind is sufficiently pure, and the purification of the mind is achieved by work in devotion. Hence, karm yog is the appropriate option for the majority of humankind. Karm yogis do their worldly duties with purified intellect, abandoning attachment to the fruits of their works, and dedicating them to God. Thus, they remain unaffected by sin, just as a lotus leaf remains untouched by the water on which it floats. With the light of knowledge, they realize the body to be like a city of nine gates within which the soul resides. Thus, they neither consider themselves as the doers nor the enjoyers of their actions. They are endowed with equality of vision and see a Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater equally. Such truly learned people develop the flawless qualities of God and become seated in the Absolute Truth. Worldly people strive to relish the pleasures that arise from the sense objects, without realizing that they are verily the source of misery. But the karm yogis do not delight in them; instead they relish the bliss of God within.</p> 
   <p>The chapter then goes on to describe the path of renunciation. The karm sanyāsīs perform austerities to control their senses, mind, and intellect. They shut out all thoughts of external enjoyment and become free from desire, fear, and anger. Then, consummating their austerities with devotion to God, they attain abiding peace.</p>

    <p> Arjun said: O Shree Krishna, you praised <i>karm sanyās</i> (the path of renunciation of actions), and you also advised to do <i>karm yog</i> (work with devotion). Please tell me decisively which of the two is more beneficial? </p>

    <p> The Supreme Lord said: Both the path of <i>karm sanyās</i> (renunciation of actions) and <i>karm yog</i> (working in devotion) lead to the supreme goal. But <i>karm yog</i> is superior to <i>karm sanyās</i>. </p>

    <p> Only the ignorant speak of <i>sānkhya</i> (renunciation of actions, or <i>karm sanyās</i>) and <i>karm yog</i> (work in devotion) as different. Those who are truly learned say that by applying ourselves to any one of these paths, we can achieve the results of both. </p>

    <p> The supreme state that is attained by means of <i>karm sanyās</i> is also attained by working in devotion. Hence, those who see <i>karm sanyās</i> and <i>karm yog</i> to be identical, truly see things as they are. </p>

    <p> Those steadfast in this <i>karm yog</i>, always think, “I am not the doer,” even while engaged in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, excreting, and grasping.
