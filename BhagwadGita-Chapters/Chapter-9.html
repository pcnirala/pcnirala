  <div class="chapterIntro"> 
   <p>In the seventh and eighth chapters, Shree Krishna declared bhakti as the easiest means of attaining Yog, and also the highest form of Yog. In the ninth chapter, he speaks of his supreme glories, which inspire awe, reverence and, devotion. He reveals that though he is standing before Arjun in his personal form, he must not be misconstrued to possess a human personality. He explains how he presides over his material energy and creates myriad life-forms at the beginning of creation, absorbs them back at the time of dissolution, and then manifests them again in the next cycle of creation. As the mighty wind blowing everywhere rests always in the sky, likewise all living beings dwell in him. And yet, by his divine Yogmaya power, he remains a neutral observer, ever aloof and detached from all these activities.</p> 
   <p>Shree Krishna resolves the apparent confusion of the Hindu pantheon by explaining that the one God is the sole object of worship. He is the goal, the support, the refuge, and the one true friend of all living beings. Those inclined toward the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas attain the celestial abodes, and when their pious merits are depleted, they return back to the earth again. But those who engage in exclusive devotion toward the Supreme Lord go to his abode. Shree Krishna thus exalts the super-excellence of unalloyed bhakti that is directed toward him. In such devotion, we must live in complete union with God’s will, offering all that we have to him, and doing everything for him alone. By such pure devotion, we will be released from the bondage of karmas and attain the goal of mystic union with God.</p> 
   <p>Further, Shree Krishna asserts that he neither favors nor rejects anyone—he is impartial toward all creatures. If even vile sinners come to his shelter, he willingly accepts them and quickly makes them virtuous and pure. He makes a promise that his devotees never perish. Seated within them, he provides what they lack and preserves what they already possess. Thus, we should always think of him, worship him, dedicate our mind and body to him, and make him our supreme goal.</p>
