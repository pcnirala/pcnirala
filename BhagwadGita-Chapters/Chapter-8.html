   <p>This chapter briefly explains several important terms and concepts that are presented more fully in the Upaniṣhads. It also describes what decides the destination of the soul after death. If we can remember God at the time of departing from the body, we will certainly attain him. Therefore, we must practice to think of him at all times, alongside with doing our daily works. We can remember him by thinking of his qualities, attributes, and virtues. We must also practice steadfast yogic concentration upon him by chanting his names. When we perfectly absorb our mind in him through exclusive devotion, we will go beyond this material dimension to the spiritual realm.</p> 
   <p>The chapter then talks about the various abodes that exist in the material realm. It explains how, in the cycle of creation, these abodes and the multitudes of beings on them come into existence, and are then again absorbed back at the time of dissolution. However, transcendental to this manifest and unmanifest creation is the divine abode of God. Those who follow the path of light, ultimately reach the divine abode, and never return to this mortal world, while those who follow the path of darkness keep transmigrating in the endless cycle of birth, disease, old age, and death.</p>

    <p> Arjun said: O Supreme Lord, what is <i>Brahman</i> (Absolute Reality), what is <i>adhyātma</i> (the individual soul), and what is karma? What is said to be <i>adhibhūta</i>, and who is said to be <i>Adhidaiva</i>? Who is <i>Adhiyajña</i> in the body and how is he the <i>Adhiyajña</i>? O Krishna, how are you to be known at the time of death by those of steadfast mind? </p>

    <p> The Blessed Lord said: The Supreme Indestructible Entity is called <i>Brahman</i>; one’s own self is called <i>adhyātma</i>. Actions pertaining to the material personality of living beings, and its development are called karma, or fruitive activities. </p>

    <p> O best of the embodied souls, the physical manifestation that is constantly changing is called <i>adhibhūta</i>; the universal form of God, which presides over the celestial gods in this creation, is called <i>adhidaiva</i>; I, who dwell in the heart of every living being, am called <i>Adhiyajña</i>, or the Lord of all sacrifices. </p>

    <p> God is omniscient, the most ancient one, the controller, subtler than the subtlest, the support of all, and the possessor of an inconceivable divine form; he is brighter than the sun, and beyond all darkness of ignorance. One who at the time of death, with unmoving mind attained by the practice of Yog, who fixes the <i>prāṇ</i> (life airs) between the eyebrows, and steadily remembers the Divine Lord with great devotion, certainly attains him. </p>

    <p> I shall now describe to you the different paths of passing away from this world, O best of the Bharatas, one of which leads to liberation and the other leads to rebirth. Those who know the Supreme <i>Brahman</i>, and who depart from this world, during the six months of the sun’s northern course, the bright fortnight of the moon, and the bright part of the day, attain the supreme destination. The practitioners of Vedic rituals, who pass away during the six months of the sun’s southern course, the dark fortnight of the moon, the time of smoke, the night, attain the celestial abodes. After enjoying celestial pleasures, they again return to the earth. These two, bright and dark paths, always exist in this world. The way of light leads to liberation and the way of darkness leads to rebirth. </p>

    <p> The yogis, who know this secret, gain merit far beyond the fruits of Vedic rituals, the study of the Vedas, performance of sacrifices, austerities, and charities. Such yogis reach the Supreme Abode. </p>
