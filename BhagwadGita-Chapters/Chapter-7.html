  <div class="chapterIntro"> 
   <p>This chapter begins by describing the material and spiritual dimensions of God’s energies. Shree Krishna explains that all these have emanated from him, and they rest in him, as beads strung on a thread. He is the source of the entire creation, and into him it again dissolves. His material energy, Maya, is very difficult to overcome, but those who surrender to him receive his grace and cross over it easily. Shree Krishna describes the four kinds of people who do not surrender to him, and the four kinds of people who engage in his devotion. Amongst his devotees, he considers as most dear, those who worship him in knowledge, with mind and intellect merged in him. Some, whose intellect has been carried away by material desires, surrender to the celestial gods. But these celestial gods can only bestow temporary material fruits, and even those, by the powers they have received from the Supreme Lord. Thus, the most worthy object of devotion is God himself. Shree Krishna confirms that he is the highest reality and ultimate attainment, possessing eternal divine attributes, such as omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence. However, his personality is hidden by a veil of his divine Yogmaya power, and hence the imperishable nature of his eternal divine form is not known to all. If we take shelter in him, he bestows upon us knowledge of himself, and on knowing him, we also get knowledge of the self and the field of karmic actions.</p>
